# Malaria-Detection
Build a computer vision model to detect malaria from images of infected red blood cells. Model uses a CNN neural network to classify parasitized or uninfected cells with a 98.69% accuracy. It is preposed that this is a potential replacement to traditional testing, with supporting cost benifit analysis and implementation strategy. 

Multiple architectures where tested including:
* Varying loss functions
* Varying levels of coplexity
* Varying activation functions
* data augmentation
* transfer learning
