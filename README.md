# Malaria-Detection
Build and train a computer vision model to detect malaria from images of infected red blood cells. Model uses a **CNN neural network to classify** parasitized and uninfected cells with a **98.69% accuracy**. EDA was done to identify key characteristics in the data that then informed the solution strategy. It is proposed that this is a potential replacement for traditional testing, with supporting cost benefit analysis and implementation strategy. 

Multiple architectures where tested including:
* Varying loss functions
* Varying levels of coplexity
* Varying activation functions
* data augmentation
* transfer learning 
From there the most best model was hyper parameterized to optimize performance.
